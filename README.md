# Clipboard OCR to Browser Text Script

This is a python script that opens a browser tab and performs a OCR on the image in your clipboard, displaying the plain-text result in the browser tab. Reruns on page reload.
Useful if you want a selectable version of unselectable text in an image or application to be accessed by screen reader or dictionary browser extensions.
